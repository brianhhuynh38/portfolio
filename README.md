# Introduction
Hello, my name is Brian Huynh. I am currently pursuing a Masters of Computer Science (MCS) at North Carolina State University (NCSU).
Here, I have decided to write about projects I have completed in a bit more detail than what is written on my resume. Feel free to take
a look at the projects by looking at the [GitHub Wiki Pages](https://github.com/brianhhuynh38/portfolio/wiki).
